# I will use a Python shell to simulate the UNIX commands and get the most frequent words in the text file. 
# Here's the pipeline:
# 1. Load the text.
# 2. Use 'tr' to replace non-alphabetic characters with newline characters, convert to lowercase, and sort.
# 3. Use 'uniq -c' to count the frequency of each word.

# We'll tokenize the text, convert it to lowercase, and count word frequencies.
